# Vietnam Town — original Aseprite shop sprites

Six original 96 × 96 transparent RGBA shop sprites. All drawing was authored as deliberate integer-coordinate pixel marks in `draw-shops.lua` and executed by the installed Aseprite binary. No source photograph was traced, imported into the artwork, or used as a texture; no image-generation tool was used.

Each `.png` has a corresponding editable native `.aseprite` document with six or seven named layers. The source includes ground/shadow, plaster/timber, tile roof, shopfront fixtures, shop goods, and finishing details. `contact-sheet.png` was assembled and enlarged using Aseprite itself.

| File | Shop | Distinguishing details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| coffee.png | Cà phê | Metal phin filters, coffee cups, low blue stools, lanterns |
| banhmi.png | Bánh mì | Striped canopy, glass baguette cart, wheels, herb crate |
| pho.png | Phở | Stockpot, curling steam, soup bowls, chopsticks, red stools |
| flowers.png | Tiệm hoa | Flower buckets, clustered blossoms, hanging planter, climbing vine |
| tailor.png | Tiệm may | Áo dài, dress form, sewing machine, balcony, fabric rolls |
| grocery.png | Tạp hóa | Tins, bottles, hanging packets, rice sacks, produce crates |

## Aseprite execution

Binary: `/Users/thohong/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Aseprite/Aseprite.app/Contents/MacOS/aseprite`

Execution arguments: `--batch --script /private/tmp/vietnamtown-shops/draw-shops.lua`

API references used: [Image](https://www.aseprite.org/api/image), [Sprite](https://www.aseprite.org/api/sprite), [Layer](https://aseprite.org/api/layer), [CLI](https://aseprite.app/docs/cli/).

Use `image-rendering: pixelated` for browser scaling. Keep the full 96 × 96 canvas: all six share the same approximate ground baseline. Transparent edge pixels are alpha 0; the ground shadow alone uses a fixed partial-alpha color.
